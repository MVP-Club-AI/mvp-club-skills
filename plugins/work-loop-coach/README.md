A methodology plugin that guides you through effective Human + AI collaboration.

## Skills

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **coach** | `work-loop-coach:coach` | Guide through Work Loop methodology |

## The Work Loop

**Articulate** → **Build** → **Prompt** → **Execute** → **Evaluate** → **Iterate**

This isn't a rigid process—it's a mental model for working effectively with AI. The coach helps you recognize where you are in the loop and what to do next.

## Usage

Invoke the coach when you need methodology guidance:
```
work-loop-coach:coach
```

The skill can also activate automatically during building tasks, providing gentle guidance without slowing you down.

## Philosophy

AI proficiency isn't about learning tools—it's about learning to think and work differently. This plugin embeds that thinking into practice.

## Installation
